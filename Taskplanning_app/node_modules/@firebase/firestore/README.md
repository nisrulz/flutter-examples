# @firebase/firestore

This is the [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) component of the
[Firebase JS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase).

**This package is not intended for direct usage, and should only be used via the officially
supported [firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) package.**

If you are developing a Node.js application that requires administrative access to Cloud Firestore,
use the [`@google-cloud/firestore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/firestore) Server
SDK with your developer credentials.
