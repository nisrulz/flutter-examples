/**
 * An IndexedDB-backed instance of Persistence. Data is stored persistently
 * across sessions.
 *
 * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence
 * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and
 * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is
 * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke
 * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.
 *
 * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK
 * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick
 * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is
 * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary
 * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to
 * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to
 * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as
 * primary.
 *
 * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only
 * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of
 * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence
 * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see
 * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from
 * persistence.
 *
 * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary
 * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as
 * the addition of new mutations and query targets.
 *
 * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary
 * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent
 * operations will automatically fail.
 *
 * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the
 * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make
 * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary
 * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload
 * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the
 * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a "zombiedClient" entry in
 * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and
 * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.
 *
 * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no
 * longer optional.
