/**
 * SyncEngine is the central controller in the client SDK architecture. It is
 * the glue code between the EventManager, LocalStore, and RemoteStore. Some of
 * SyncEngine's responsibilities include:
 * 1. Coordinating client requests and remote events between the EventManager
 *    and the local and remote data stores.
 * 2. Managing a View object for each query, providing the unified view between
 *    the local and remote data stores.
 * 3. Notifying the RemoteStore when the LocalStore has new mutations in its
 *    queue that need sending to the backend.
 *
 * The SyncEngineâ€™s methods should only ever be called by methods running in the
 * global async queue.
 *
 * PORTING NOTE: On Web, SyncEngine does not have an explicit subscribe()
 * function. Instead, it directly depends on EventManager's tree-shakeable API
 * (via `ensureWatchStream()`).
