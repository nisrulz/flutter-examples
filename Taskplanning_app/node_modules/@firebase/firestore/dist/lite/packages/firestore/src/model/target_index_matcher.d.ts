     *
     * An index is considered capable of serving the target when:
     * - The target uses all index segments for its filters and orderBy clauses.
     *   The target can have additional filter and orderBy clauses, but not
     *   fewer.
     * - If an ArrayContains/ArrayContainsAnyfilter is used, the index must also
     *   have a corresponding `CONTAINS` segment.
     * - All directional index segments can be mapped to the target as a series of
     *   equality filters, a single inequality filter and a series of orderBy
     *   clauses.
     * - The segments that represent the equality filters may appear out of order.
     * - The optional segment for the inequality filter must appear after all
     *   equality segments.
     * - The segments that represent that orderBy clause of the target must appear
     *   in order after all equality and inequality segments. Single orderBy
     *   clauses cannot be skipped, but a continuous orderBy suffix may be
     *   omitted.
