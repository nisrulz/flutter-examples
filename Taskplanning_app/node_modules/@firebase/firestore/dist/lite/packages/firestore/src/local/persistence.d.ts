 * Persistence is the lowest-level shared interface to persistent storage in
 * Firestore.
 *
 * Persistence is used to create MutationQueue and RemoteDocumentCache
 * instances backed by persistence (which might be in-memory or LevelDB).
 *
 * Persistence also exposes an API to create and run PersistenceTransactions
 * against persistence. All read / write operations must be wrapped in a
 * transaction. Implementations of PersistenceTransaction / Persistence only
 * need to guarantee that writes made against the transaction are not made to
 * durable storage until the transaction resolves its PersistencePromise.
 * Since memory-only storage components do not alter durable storage, they are
 * free to ignore the transaction.
 *
 * This contract is enough to allow the LocalStore be be written
 * independently of whether or not the stored state actually is durably
 * persisted. If persistent storage is enabled, writes are grouped together to
 * avoid inconsistent state that could cause crashes.
 *
 * Concretely, when persistent storage is enabled, the persistent versions of
 * MutationQueue, RemoteDocumentCache, and others (the mutators) will
 * defer their writes into a transaction. Once the local store has completed
 * one logical operation, it commits the transaction.
 *
 * When persistent storage is disabled, the non-persistent versions of the
 * mutators ignore the transaction. This short-cut is allowed because
 * memory-only storage leaves no state so it cannot be inconsistent.
 *
 * This simplifies the implementations of the mutators and allows memory-only
 * implementations to supplement the persistent ones without requiring any
 * special dual-store implementation of Persistence. The cost is that the
 * LocalStore needs to be slightly careful about the order of its reads and
 * writes in order to avoid relying on being able to read back uncommitted
 * writes.
