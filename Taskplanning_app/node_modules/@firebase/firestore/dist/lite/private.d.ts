 * - 'unknown': Unknown error or an error from a different error domain.
 * - 'invalid-argument': Client specified an invalid argument. Note that this
 *   differs from 'failed-precondition'. 'invalid-argument' indicates
 *   arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system
 *   (e.g. an invalid field name).
 * - 'deadline-exceeded': Deadline expired before operation could complete.
 *   For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be
 *   returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example,
 *   a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough
 *   for the deadline to expire.
 * - 'not-found': Some requested document was not found.
 * - 'already-exists': Some document that we attempted to create already
 *   exists.
 * - 'permission-denied': The caller does not have permission to execute the
 *   specified operation.
 * - 'resource-exhausted': Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a
 *   per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.
 * - 'failed-precondition': Operation was rejected because the system is not
 *   in a state required for the operation's execution.
 * - 'aborted': The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency
 *   issue like transaction aborts, etc.
 * - 'out-of-range': Operation was attempted past the valid range.
 * - 'unimplemented': Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled.
 * - 'internal': Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by
 *   underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors,
 *   something is very broken.
 * - 'unavailable': The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely
 *   a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff.
 * - 'data-loss': Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.
 * - 'unauthenticated': The request does not have valid authentication
 *   credentials for the operation.

/**
 * A mutation describes a self-contained change to a document. Mutations can

 *
 * For local mutations (mutations that haven't been committed yet), we preserve
 * the existing version for Set and Patch mutations. For Delete mutations, we
 * reset the version to 0.
 *
 * Here's the expected transition table.
 *
 * MUTATION           APPLIED TO            RESULTS IN
 *
 * SetMutation        Document(v3)          Document(v3)

 * DeleteMutation     InvalidDocument(v0)   NoDocument(v0)
 *
 * For acknowledged mutations, we use the updateTime of the WriteResponse as
 * the resulting version for Set and Patch mutations. As deletes have no
 * explicit update time, we use the commitTime of the WriteResponse for
 * Delete mutations.
 *
 * If a mutation is acknowledged by the backend but fails the precondition check
 * locally, we transition to an `UnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us
 * the updated version.
 *
 * Field transforms are used only with Patch and Set Mutations. We use the
 * `updateTransforms` message to store transforms, rather than the `transforms`s
 * messages.
 *
 * ## Subclassing Notes
 *
 * Every type of mutation needs to implement its own applyToRemoteDocument() and
 * applyToLocalView() to implement the actual behavior of applying the mutation
 * to some source document (see `setMutationApplyToRemoteDocument()` for an

 * Persistence is the lowest-level shared interface to persistent storage in
 * Firestore.
 *
 * Persistence is used to create MutationQueue and RemoteDocumentCache
 * instances backed by persistence (which might be in-memory or LevelDB).
 *
 * Persistence also exposes an API to create and run PersistenceTransactions
 * against persistence. All read / write operations must be wrapped in a
 * transaction. Implementations of PersistenceTransaction / Persistence only
 * need to guarantee that writes made against the transaction are not made to
 * durable storage until the transaction resolves its PersistencePromise.
 * Since memory-only storage components do not alter durable storage, they are
 * free to ignore the transaction.
 *
 * This contract is enough to allow the LocalStore be be written
 * independently of whether or not the stored state actually is durably
 * persisted. If persistent storage is enabled, writes are grouped together to
 * avoid inconsistent state that could cause crashes.
 *
 * Concretely, when persistent storage is enabled, the persistent versions of
 * MutationQueue, RemoteDocumentCache, and others (the mutators) will
 * defer their writes into a transaction. Once the local store has completed
 * one logical operation, it commits the transaction.
 *
 * When persistent storage is disabled, the non-persistent versions of the
 * mutators ignore the transaction. This short-cut is allowed because
 * memory-only storage leaves no state so it cannot be inconsistent.
 *
 * This simplifies the implementations of the mutators and allows memory-only
 * implementations to supplement the persistent ones without requiring any
 * special dual-store implementation of Persistence. The cost is that the
 * LocalStore needs to be slightly careful about the order of its reads and
 * writes in order to avoid relying on being able to read back uncommitted
 * writes.
