 * - 'cancelled': The operation was cancelled (typically by the caller).
 * - 'unknown': Unknown error or an error from a different error domain.
 * - 'invalid-argument': Client specified an invalid argument. Note that this
 *   differs from 'failed-precondition'. 'invalid-argument' indicates
 *   arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system
 *   (e.g. an invalid field name).
 * - 'deadline-exceeded': Deadline expired before operation could complete.
 *   For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be
 *   returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example,
 *   a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough
 *   for the deadline to expire.
 * - 'not-found': Some requested document was not found.
 * - 'already-exists': Some document that we attempted to create already
 *   exists.
 * - 'permission-denied': The caller does not have permission to execute the
 *   specified operation.
 * - 'resource-exhausted': Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a
 *   per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.
 * - 'failed-precondition': Operation was rejected because the system is not
 *   in a state required for the operation's execution.
 * - 'aborted': The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency
 *   issue like transaction aborts, etc.
 * - 'out-of-range': Operation was attempted past the valid range.
 * - 'unimplemented': Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled.
 * - 'internal': Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by
 *   underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors,
 *   something is very broken.
 * - 'unavailable': The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely
 *   a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff.
 * - 'data-loss': Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.
 * - 'unauthenticated': The request does not have valid authentication
 *   credentials for the operation.
