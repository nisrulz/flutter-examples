     * If only the event is passed, a function that can be used to register the
     * callbacks is returned. Otherwise, the callbacks are passed after the event.

     * Callbacks can be passed either as three separate arguments <em>or</em> as the
     * `next`, `error`, and `complete` properties of an object. Any of the three
     * callbacks is optional, as long as at least one is specified. In addition,
     * when you add your callbacks, you get a function back. You can call this
     * function to unregister the associated callbacks.
     *
     * @example **Pass callbacks separately or in an object.**
     * ```javascript
     * var next = function(snapshot) {};
     * var error = function(error) {};
     * var complete = function() {};
     *

     * // This is equivalent to the first example.
     * uploadTask.on(firebase.storage.TaskEvent.STATE_CHANGED, {
     *   'next': next,
     *   'error': error,
     *   'complete': complete
     * });
     *
     * // This is equivalent to the first example.
     * var subscribe = uploadTask.on(firebase.storage.TaskEvent.STATE_CHANGED);
     * subscribe(next, error, complete);
     *
     * // This is equivalent to the first example.
     * var subscribe = uploadTask.on(firebase.storage.TaskEvent.STATE_CHANGED);
     * subscribe({
     *   'next': next,
     *   'error': error,
     *   'complete': complete
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * @example **Any callback is optional.**
     * ```javascript
     * // Just listening for completion, this is legal.
     * uploadTask.on(
     *     firebase.storage.TaskEvent.STATE_CHANGED,
     *     null,
     *     null,

     * // Just listening for progress/state changes, this is legal.
     * uploadTask.on(firebase.storage.TaskEvent.STATE_CHANGED, function(snapshot) {
     *   var percent = snapshot.bytesTransferred / snapshot.totalBytes * 100;
     *   console.log(percent + "% done");

     *     console.log('upload complete!');
     *   }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * @example **Use the returned function to remove callbacks.**
     * ```javascript
     * var unsubscribe = uploadTask.on(
     *     firebase.storage.TaskEvent.STATE_CHANGED,
     *     function(snapshot) {
