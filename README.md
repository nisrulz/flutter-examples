# Get packages for all flutter projects

- Once you have cloned this repo, navigate to the root of this repo.
- Next run `./get_packages.sh`
  > Make sure the script is executable. If it is not, then run `chmod +x get_packages.sh` first to make it executable.
- Done!

# Pull Requests

I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:

1. Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using `Reformat Code` feature of Android Studio `CMD`+`Option`+`L` on Mac and `CTRL` + `ALT` + `L` on Linux + Windows .
1. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
1. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
1. Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
1. Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/nisrulz/flutter-examples/issues) first, before filing an issue.
1. Make sure you follow the set standard as all other projects in this repo do
   > Make sure the package name conforms to the format: `github.nisrulz.<app_name>`
1. Have fun!


## Extra
Since the repo is pretty large now , I am sure many folks would like to download only some of the projects. To tackle that follow the steps below:
  - Install `svn` using homebrew (mac/linux)
    ```bash
    brew install svn
    ```
  - Copy the name of the example folder in this repo i.e `simple_material_app`
  - Next replace `example_folder` in the below command:

    ```bash
    svn checkout https://github.com/nisrulz/flutter-examples/trunk/example_folder
    ```
    i.e Consider `simple_material_app` is the name of the example's folder, the command becomes:
    ```bash
    svn checkout https://github.com/nisrulz/flutter-examples/trunk/simple_material_app
    ```
  - Done! You should have the specific example all checked out!
